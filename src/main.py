### Project Overview

Welcome to our data story on **the history of pandemics in Switzerland**.  
This project dives deep into how past pandemics unfolded across the country,  
and what we can learn from them today.

We explore:
- The spread and intensity of influenza and other pandemics
- Mortality, morbidity, and excess death trends
- Geographic distribution and regional impacts across Swiss cantons
- Causes of death and shifts in epidemiology over time


### Data & Visualizations

This dashboard is based on static historical data from the Swiss National Science Foundation project  
**"Bridging the Gap"**, hosted on **[leaddata.ch](https://www.leaddata.ch)**.

We use three core datasets:
- Dataset 1: Pandemic history (COVID, Influenza, excess mortality)
- Dataset 2: Canton-level details from the 1950s (cases, deaths, population)
- Dataset 3: Causes of death in Switzerland from 1876‚Äì2002

    In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted life across the globe. In Switzerland, as in many countries, society paused, reeled, and eventually adapted. As the emergency fades, a question lingers:
    > **Have we really learned from this crisis‚Äîor are we doomed to forget, again?**
    This project invites you on a journey. A journey through 130 years of Swiss pandemic history, told through data: deaths, diseases, and resilience. We visualize key insights from historical records to better understand how pandemics shaped our past‚Äîand how they can guide our future.
    #### How Deadly Were Past Pandemics?
    When people think of pandemics, COVID-19 is top of mind. But how does it compare to earlier pandemics?
    To answer this, we looked at death rates from major pandemics in Switzerland from 1889 to 2020, measured per 100,000 people. The bar chart below reveals the toll of each crisis:

    - The 2009 Swine Flu was comparatively mild in Switzerland.

    COVID-19 was not the deadliest pandemic in Swiss history. In fact, the Spanish Flu of 1918 remains unmatched in scale.

    To understand the true cost of pandemics, we looked beyond reported causes of death. Sometimes, people die because of a pandemic, but not from the disease itself‚Äîindirect effects like delayed treatments, overwhelmed hospitals, or social disruptions can all lead to excess deaths.

    This is where excess mortality becomes essential. It measures how many people died above or below what we would statistically expect in a normal year, based on historical trends.

    **How to read the graph:**

    - Each dot represents a year between 1880 and 2022.
    - **Purple dots** mean more people died than expected ‚Üí positive excess mortality.

        This often occurs during severe flu seasons, pandemics, heatwaves, or crises.

    - **Blue dots** mean fewer people died than expected ‚Üí negative excess mortality.

        This can reflect milder flu seasons, improved healthcare, or social measures like lockdowns reducing accidents.

    st.markdown("""
    When we think about causes of death, influenza often doesn‚Äôt come to mind first. Most people associate it with discomfort or seasonal sickness ‚Äî not with mortality. Yet when we look closely at historical data, a different picture begins to emerge.
    Between 1953 and 1958, monthly death records from Switzerland show that flu outbreaks leave a clear seasonal trace. While the total number of deaths remained relatively stable, flu-related deaths would suddenly spike in winter months ‚Äî especially in early 1953, early 1956, and the winter of 1957/58.
     These spikes are not random. They line up with documented influenza epidemics, including the well-known Asian Flu (H2N2), which began spreading worldwide in 1957. In Switzerland, this particular wave peaked in December 1957 to January 1958, causing a noticeable but temporary rise in flu deaths.
    However, even at their highest, influenza deaths remained just a small fraction of total mortality. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre often overlooked and influenza's impact tends to blend into the bigger picture.
    Still, this matters. Even when it doesn‚Äôt dominate the statistics, influenza adds pressure to healthcare systems and contributes to seasonal death surges. These seasonal patterns show us that flu is not always deadly, but in certain years, it can be very serious ‚Äî especially for older or vulnerable people.

    **Key takeaways from the visualization below:**

    - Flu death spikes are clearly visible in winters of 1953, 1956, and 1957/58.
    - The 1957/58 peak matches the timing of the global Asian Flu pandemic (H2N2).
    - Total mortality remains mostly stable, but seasonal fluctuations include hidden flu effects.
    - Context matters: cold winters, aging populations, and coexisting illnesses all influence death patterns.

    *Note:*

    - All charts and data refer to Switzerland between 1953 and 1958.
    - Data from September to December 1958 is incomplete. This analysis includes only the fully documented period from January 1953 to August 1958.
    
    The plot shows how flu deaths (purple) compare to total deaths (blue) over time. You can see that flu rarely dominates, but it spikes sharply in some winters.
    In most months, flu caused less than 1% of all deaths. But during major outbreaks, such as winter 1957/58, flu accounted for over 10% of monthly deaths.
    ‚û§ This tells us: Even if influenza doesn‚Äôt always cause mass mortality, it can play a big role in certain years. That‚Äôs why flu prevention, vaccination, and awareness remain important ‚Äî especially in colder months.

    In the fall of 1957, a new influenza strain ‚Äî H2N2, also known as the Asian Flu ‚Äî reached Switzerland. By October, health officials were recording over 30,000 flu cases per week, as shown in the first chart below. This was an unprecedented surge.

    However, something interesting happened: deaths didn‚Äôt rise as dramatically as expected. While cases skyrocketed, monthly flu deaths peaked at fewer than 500 ‚Äî high, but relatively small considering the size of the outbreak.

    Why were there so many infections, but relatively few deaths?

    - Lower severity: H2N2 spread rapidly, but caused fewer severe cases and deaths compared to earlier pandemics.
    - Younger population: Switzerland‚Äôs population in the 1950s was younger, meaning fewer high-risk elderly people.
    - Antibiotics: These were more widely available to treat deadly complications like pneumonia.
    - Better preparedness: Hospitals and health systems had improved significantly since earlier pandemics.
    - Vaccination: Some early flu vaccines were already in use, helping to reduce severity, even if they didn‚Äôt prevent all infections.

    As we return from our data journey, we zoom out to see the bigger picture. The history of pandemics is only one thread in a much broader transformation:
    How the causes of death in Switzerland have changed over nearly 150 years.

    **The Decline of Infectious Diseases**
    In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, measles, diphtheria, scarlet fever, and whooping cough were leading causes of death in Switzerland.

    - Several key developments contributed to their decline:

    - Public sanitation and clean water infrastructure drastically reduced the spread of waterborne and respiratory diseases.

    - Widespread vaccination campaigns targeted diseases like smallpox, measles, and diphtheria, dramatically lowering incidence and mortality.

    - The discovery and use of antibiotics, starting in the 1940s, enabled effective treatment of bacterial infections that had once been fatal.

    In the 19th century, tuberculosis alone accounted for a major share of deaths in cities like Bern.
